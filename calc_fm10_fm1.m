function [fm10,fm1]=calc_fm10(temp,rh,sow);
% code computes daily 1-hr and 10-hr dead fuel moistures (fm1, fm10)
% inputs: temp, rh; these should be instantaneous, typically 1300




%   # THIS SUBROUTINE CALCULATES FM10.  THERE IS ADDITIONAL CODE
%   #   IN BRADSHAW FOR WHEN THE CURRENT FM10 IS LE 0.  THIS HAS NOT BEEN
%   #   INTEGRATED IN THIS CODE AS OF YET.  ALSO, SOW HAS YET TO BE DETERMINED,
%   #    SO THAT WILL HAVE TO BE ADJUSTED FOR LATER.
%   # THIS SUBROUTINE ALSO USES THE ORIGINAL EMC CALCULATION INSTEAD OF THE
%   #   ONE WHICH USES HF AND TF.  THIS CAN BE EMPOLYED LATER ONCE SOW IS KNOWN
%
%   # ACCORDING TO BRADSHAW [EMAIL] THIS PROGRAM WILL ALWAYS START WITH FM10=0
%   # SINCE THE SOW IS 0, FM10/FM1 SHOULD ONLY BE CALCULATED BASED UPON EMD
%   #    AND FM100
%
%   # LARRY'S CODE COMPUTES A SINGLE EMC BASED UPON THE TEMP/RH ADJUSTMENTS
%   #    CORRESPONDING TO SOW=0 (I.E. 1ST ELEMENT IN ADJUSTMENT ARRAYS) <VIA
%   #    EMAIL WITH LARRY 12/07/01>
%
%   # NEW ACCOUTING FOR SOW (CHRIS FONTANA (3/12/02): ASSUME SOW IS 0
%   #   DURING THE DAY AND 3 AT NIGHT.  IF PRECIP IS RECEIVED IN
%   #   PREVIOUS HOUR, THE SOW WILL BE 8.  IF PRECIP IS RECEIVED IN
%   #   PREVIOUS 2 HOURS, THE SOW WILL BE 6
